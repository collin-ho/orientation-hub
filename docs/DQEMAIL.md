Hi DQ,

I'm reaching out to request assistance with setting up a Microsoft Graph API integration for our Orientation Management System. This integration will automate calendar invites and email notifications for our PD orientation classes, eliminating manual scheduling work and ensuring consistent communication.  I beta tested this using a middleware and it worked well, so I would like to move it to our own codebase.

Currently, our orientation process requires manual creation of calendar invites for each session (typically 30+ sessions per class) and individual welcome emails to orientees. This automation will:

- Save 2-3 hours per orientation class in manual scheduling
- Eliminate scheduling errors and missed invitations  
- Ensure consistent professional communication from a dedicated orientation email
- Improve orientee experience with timely, automated welcome emails
- Integrate seamlessly with our existing ClickUp-based orientation tracking system


I need an Azure App Registration created with Microsoft Graph API permissions to enable our Node.js application to send calendar invites and emails on behalf of our organization.


Configuration Details:

Application Name: "Cogent Analytics - Orientation Management System"
Supported Account Types: "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Cogent Analytics only)"
Redirect URI Type: Web
Redirect URIs: 
•	 http://localhost:4000/auth/callback (for development testing)
•	[Production URL to be added later when ready for deployment]

Note: I'll provide the production redirect URI when we're ready to deploy the system. 
For now, the localhost URL is sufficient for development and testing.



The application requires these Microsoft Graph permissions:

Calendar Permissions:
- Calendars.ReadWrite - Create and manage calendar events for orientation sessions
- Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared - Access shared calendars if we use a shared orientation calendar
- Calendars.Read - Check for scheduling conflicts before creating events

Email Permissions:
- Mail.Send - Send welcome emails and notifications to orientees  
- Mail.Send.Shared - Send emails from shared mailbox (orientation@cogentanalytics.com)

User & Directory Permissions:
- User.Read - Read basic user profile information
- User.Read.All - Look up user profiles to add instructors to calendar invites
- Directory.Read.All - Enhanced user discovery and organizational structure access

Teams & Meeting Permissions:
- OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite - Create Teams meeting links for virtual orientation sessions
- MailboxSettings.Read - Respect user timezone preferences for accurate scheduling
- Team.ReadBasic.All - Read Teams information
- Channel.ReadBasic.All - Read Teams channels
- ChatMessage.Send  -  Send Teams messages
- Chat.ReadWrite – Send 1:1 Messages


Other Permissions
- Sites.ReadWrite.All - SharePoint integration for orientation materials
- Files.ReadWrite.All - Document management and attachment capabilities
- Group.ReadWrite.All - Cohort group management for organizing orientees
- Reports.Read.All                 # Read usage reports
- AuditLog.Read.All               # Read audit logs


Step 3: Grant Admin Consent
After adding the permissions:
1. Go to `API Permissions` tab in the app registration
2. Click  "Grant admin consent for Cogent Analytics"
3. Confirm consent for all requested permissions

Create Client Secret

1. New client secret
2. Description: "Orientation System - Production Secret"  
3. Expiration: 24 months (recommended for production stability)
4. **Important:** Copy the secret **VALUE** (not the Secret ID) immediately - it won't be shown again


Security Considerations

This integration follows Microsoft security best practices:

- Client Credentials Flow - No user interaction required, runs as service https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/best-practices-concept
- Principle of Least Privilege - Only requests necessary permissions https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow
- Environment Variables - All secrets stored securely, never in code https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/secrets-best-practices
- Audit Trail - All calendar/email actions are logged
- Expiring Secrets - Client secret has 24-month expiration for regular rotation

Information I Need
Once the setup is complete, please provide me with:

1. Client ID (Application ID from the app registration overview)
2. Client Secret Value  
3. Tenant ID (found in Azure AD → Overview)

Example format:
Client ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
Client Secret: AbC123XyZ789... (the actual secret value)
Tenant ID: 87654321-4321-4321-4321-cba987654321

Note: With these permissions, the system will be able to:
- Generate Teams meeting links automatically for virtual sessions
- Check for calendar conflicts before scheduling
- Integrate with SharePoint for document management
- Support future enhancements without additional admin requests

Testing & Validation

Once I receive the credentials, I can immediately test the integration:

1. Connection Test - Verify authentication is working
2. Email Test - Send a test welcome email  
3. Calendar Test - Create a test calendar invite
4. Full Integration Test - Process a complete orientation class


Questions & Additional Information

If you have any questions about this request or need additional technical details, I'm happy to provide more information.  

 If there are any corporate policies or additional approval processes required for Microsoft Graph API integrations, please let me know and I can provide additional documentation or go through the appropriate channels.
