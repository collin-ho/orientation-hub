# Proposed Feature: ClickUp-to-Calendar Automation

This document outlines a proposed implementation for adding a ClickUp-to-Calendar automation service to the existing `feedback-forms` project. This feature was sidelined and these notes are for future implementation.

## Background

The existing `feedback-forms` project is a Node.js/Express application that integrates with ClickUp's API to handle orientation feedback submissions. It creates tasks in ClickUp with custom fields and includes utilities for managing ClickUp data.

The project's existing structure and Node.js/ClickUp integration experience make it a good foundation for the new automation.

## Proposed Implementation

The new automation will be added as a new module within the existing project.

### Architectural Approach

- **New Service:** A new service will be created for the calendar automation.
- **Reuse Utilities:** The existing ClickUp utilities (`utils/clickup-client.js`) will be shared.
- **Microsoft Graph API:** Integration with the Microsoft Graph API will be added to manage calendar events.
- **ClickUp Webhooks:** A webhook endpoint will be set up to receive notifications from ClickUp when tasks are updated.

### Proposed File Structure

The following additions would be made to the project structure:

```
feedback-forms/
├── services/
│   ├── calendar-automation/
│   │   ├── clickup-webhook.js      # Handles incoming webhooks from ClickUp
│   │   ├── ms-graph.js             # Contains logic for interacting with MS Graph API
│   │   └── event-processor.js      # Processes webhook data and creates calendar events
├── utils/
│   ├── clickup-client.js (existing)
│   └── ms-graph-client.js (new)      # A new client for MS Graph API
...
```

### New Dependencies

The following npm packages would need to be added to `package.json`:

- `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client`: For Microsoft 365 integration.
- `node-cron`: As a potential alternative for scheduling if webhooks are not used.

## Future Implementation Steps

1.  **Add Microsoft Graph Integration:** Implement the `ms-graph-client.js` and `ms-graph.js` modules.
2.  **Set up ClickUp Webhook:** Create the `clickup-webhook.js` endpoint to listen for task updates.
3.  **Implement Event Logic:** Write the logic in `event-processor.js` to create calendar events based on ClickUp data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting implementation, the following is needed:

-   **Microsoft 365 API Credentials:** Valid credentials for the Microsoft Graph API need to be obtained and configured as environment variables.
